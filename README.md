# Raster-Based-Graphics-Pipeline

# 4 stages of the pipeline.

1. Stage 1: modeling transformation 
2. Stage 2: view transformation 
3. Stage 3: projection transformation 
4. Stage 4: clipping &amp; scan conversion using Z-buffer algorithm


This program will output five files: stage1.txt, stage2.txt, stage3.txt and
z-buffer.txt, out.bmp. The first three files will contain the output of the first three stages,
respectively. The fourth file will contain z-buffer values (only those which are less than the max value).
And the fifth file will be a bmp image generated by the pipeline.
Three will be two input files: scene.txt and config.txt
The first file will contain the scene description and second file will contain the necessary information for
the Z-buffer algorithm.
